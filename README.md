## [Level 1 - Crop identification](https://challenge.ey.com/challenges/level-1-crop-identification-ey)

1. Hunger is a global problem. To build tools to tackle hunger, we must start by understanding a single crop at a single location. Rice is a staple food for fou billion people, more than half of the world's populations. It is the livelihood for a fifth of the global population. But both the amount of land available for rice and the yield growth rates are in decline. Enroll in this challenge to build models that can identify the areas where rice is cultivated. The results can then be extrapolated to other locations and even other crops. The team, or individual, placing first will receive: U$ 1,500


## [Level 2 – Crop forecasting](https://challenge.ey.com/challenges/level-2-crop-forecasting-ey)

1. Climate change, along with man-made conflicts and economic downturns are some of the main causes of acute hunger. Enroll in this challenge to learn how to build models that will help scientists better understand the impact of climate change on crop yields.You will use data from Microsoft's Planetary Computer including Sentinel-1 (radar), Sentinel-2 (optical) and Landsat (optical) satellite data to forecast yield for any identified area of rice cultivation. The winner receives a cash prize of U$$ 10,000 and the first runner up receives US$ 5.000. The winner and two runners up are also invited to an awards ceremony in New York City.
