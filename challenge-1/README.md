# Overview - Completing the challenge

- The time required to complete this level is approximately 30 hours.
- This challenge is to predict the presence of rice crop at 250 geo locations (latitude and longitude) in the An Giang province of Vietnam using satellite data.
- You will be given an example Jupyter notebook with a preliminary F1 score of 0.55. The notebook connects to public facing data sources on Microsoft's Planetary Computer. The output of the notebook is a .csv file that can be uploaded to the challenge platform, which you can improve over the course of the challenge.
- Watch this video to learn [how to get started and make a submission](https://challenge.ey.com/getting-started-2023/help) and claim your spot on the EY Open Science Data Challenge ranking board.
- Watch this video for some tipos on [how to improve your model performance.](https://challenge.ey.com/challenge-2023-level-2/help).
- Opportunities for improvement include but are not limited to; explore other bands from Sentinel-1-RTC, use combinations of many bands from the Sentinel-1-RTC, generate various vegetation indices to be used as features, extract VV and VH band values for an entire year and summarize using time-series metrics, explore the approach of building a bounding box around the given latitude and longitude positions, try other classification algorithms, and hypeparameter tuning.
- The output will be a rice crop classification model that can distinguish between a rice and non-rice field.
- Identifying areas where rice is growing is important for prioritizing actions intended to esure food security.
