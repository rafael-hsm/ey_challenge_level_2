# Overview - Completing the challenge

- The estimated time effor this level requires is approximately 50 hours.
- This challenge is to predict the yield of rice crop for a given season at 100 geo locations (latitude and longitude) in the Chau Thanh, Thoai Son and Chau Phu regions of Vietnam using satellite data.
- The objective is to develop a regression model for predicting the rice yield for a given season at a given geo location using satellite data.
- The datasets used: For target variable: Rice yield data from Chau Thanh, Thoai Son and Chau Phu regions of Vietnam. For predictor variables: Satellite data available on Microsoft Planetary Computer portal.

- An example Jupyter notebook (link to be provided once the competition opens) has been built, which has a preliminary R2 score. The notebook connects to public facing data sources on Microsoft's Planetary Computer. The outpu of the notebook is a .csv file that can be uploaded to the challenge platform, which you can improve over the course of the challenge.
- Opportunities for improvement include but are not limited to explore data from multiple satellites, use combinations of bands from satellite, generate various vegetation indices to be used as features, build bounding box of different sizes aroud the given latitude and longitude positions, try other regression algorithms, and hyperparameter tunning.
